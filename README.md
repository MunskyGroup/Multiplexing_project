This repository contains the codes necessary to reproduce figures from the above manuscript. All codes are implemented in Python and Matlab 2019b. <br/>


## Code organization <br/>

The codes are organized on the following categories. <br/>

* **Simulations for the selected model and the optimized parameter values** <br/>
 run__test.m <br/>
 
## Experimental data. <br/>

* **Experimental data is located in the following directory:** <br/>
Multiplexing_Data <br/>
 
* **Intensity time courses** <br/>

---

## Gene Sequences. <br/>
test.txt <br/>

---  

## Code implementation.<br/>

To reproduce the results given in Figure X of the manuscript use: <br/>
run__Selected_Model.m <br/>
 
 ---  

## Folders with simulation results. <br/>
test. <br/>

 ---  
## Cluster implementation.<br/>
The codes performing the optimization and uncertainty (run__Cluster_Optmization.m and  run__Parameter_Uncertainty.m), rely upon expensive computations that were performed on the W.M. Keck Compute Cluster. <br/>
